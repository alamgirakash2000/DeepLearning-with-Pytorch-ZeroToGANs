## Overview

“Deep Learning with PyTorch: Zero to GANs” is an online course intended to
provide a CodingFirst introduction to deep learning using the PyTorch framework.
The course takes a hands-on coding-focused approach and will be taught using
live interactive Jupyter notebooks, allowing students to follow along and
experiment. Theoretical concepts will be explained in simple terms using code.

## Topics Covered:

- Pytorch Basics and Tensor
- Linear and Logistic Regression
- Deep Neural Networks (NN)
- Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Residual Network (ResNet) Architecture
- Training Model on GPU
- Data Augmentation, Regularization
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Transfer Learning
